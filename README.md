This is a snake game. The snake moves all the time, you can direct it with arrows.

Each time it eats an apple, it grows one square.

If the apple was "crazy", the snake gets fuzzy and it will misunderstand your commands (it inverts them, right-left and up-down) until it eats a normal apple.

The score counts the eaten apples.

While the score goes up, snake's speed goes slowly up, too.

You may take a pause in the game by pressing "space"; press "space" again  to continue.

Press "enter" to go back to Start Menu.

Have fun!
